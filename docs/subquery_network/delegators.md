## What is a Delegator?

A Delegator is a non-technical network role in the SubQuery network and is a great way to start contributing to the SubQuery network. This role enables Delegators to “delegate” their SQT to one or more Indexers. Delegators benefit by having their SQT earn a “commission reward” for their efforts. On the other hand, Indexers benefit by acquiring more SQT to stake towards their projects of interest, thereby increasing their earning potential. 

Without Delegators, Indexers will likely earn fewer rewards because they will have less SQT to allocate. Therefore, Indexers compete to attract Delegators by offering a competitive share of an Indexer’s revenue.


## How to select Indexers?

Delegators can select potential Indexers based on a “Reputation Index” or RI. This RI takes into account an Indexer’s uptime, ICR, slashing events, and Indexer parameter change frequency. 


## Requirements to be a Delegator

One of the best things about being a Delegator is that you don’t need any powerful computer configuration and specific technical requirements. Any computer with a connection to the internet is all that is required to become a Delegator.


## How Delegators are rewarded?

To attract Delegators to support their activities, Indexers offer potential Delegators a share of the rewards they earn. The primary goal of an Indexer is to earn fees for the Indexing service they provide. Delegators help Indexers to effectively achieve these goals. With a purpose to attract Delegators, an Indexer advertises the portion of revenue that the Indexer will share with the Delegator. That portion is called the Indexer’s Commission Rate. 

Indexer’s Commission Rate: This is a percentage share of the fees earned from serving requests to Consumers. Indexers are free to set this rate to any value they desire. A higher percentage indicates that Indexers keep more of the profits. A lower percentage indicates that the Indexers share more of their profits with their Delegators.


## Benefits of being a Delegator

There are several benefits of becoming a Delegator:

* Easy to get started - Requiring little technical knowledge, Delegators only need to acquire SQT tokens and then learn the process of delegating the tokens to their preferred Indexer(s). 
* Contribute to the network - Indexers serve blockchain data to their customers. Delegating to Indexers is a way to support an Indexer’s initiative. In return, Delegators are rewarded.
* To earn rewards - Delegators can put their SQT to work by delegating their SQT to Indexers and earning a share of the reward pool. 
* No minimum limit - There is no minimum limit to be a Delegator. This means that anyone can join no matter how many SQT one has. 


## Risks of being a Delegator

Even though it is not considered a risky role, being a Delegator includes a few risks to be aware of. 

1. Market volatility risk:  The constant fluctuations in the market is a risk that affects not just SQT, but all tokens in the general cryptocurrency marketplace. Taking a long term approach can reduce this type of risk.  
2. Constant adjustments of staking parameters by Indexers and delegation fees can increase the risk to a Delegator. For example, a Delegator might miss a change in staking parameters resulting in a less than expected return. To reduce this risk, when Indexers decrease their stake parameters, it will only take effect after the next full Era has been completed. 
3. Indexer poor performance: It is possible that Delegators can select Indexers that perform poorly and therefore provide a substandard return on investment to Delegators. Delegators are therefore encouraged to do Indexer due diligence on potential Indexers. A Reputation Index is also available to help Delegators compare Indexers to each other. 


## Delegation fee

The protocol charges a delegation fee of 0.5% for every delegation of tokens to an Indexer.


## Non-reward period

Besides the period when Delegators can effectively earn money, a non-reward period also occurs. Delegators receive revenue for staking eras that they were a part of for the entire duration. For example, if a Delegator joins a staking era halfway through, they will not earn any revenue for that particular era. 

Additionally, if a Delegator decides to undelegate his/her SQT, a 28 day thawing period starts. The tokens cannot be moved during this period, no fees can be accrued or a reward acquired.


## Indexer due diligence for Delegators

Once a preferred Indexer(s) is found, due diligence should be performed to check an Indexer’s reputation and reliability. Assessments could be performed to evaluate if the Indexer is active in the community, if the Indexer helping other members, is it possible to get in touch with the Indexer, and if the Indexer is up-to-date with the protocol updates. 


## Steps for delegation

1. Delegators bonds (deposit into) SQT into a global staking contract. 
2. Delegators can then decide how much to stake to each Indexer of their choice. 
3. Delegator can un-stake tokens making them available for re-staking. These unstaked tokens can be re-staked again at any point in time. This process is known as re-balancing and will trigger a withdrawal claim event due to the Indexer/Delegator stake ratio changing.
4. Delegators can un-bond “available” tokens. When this action is executed, tokens enter a 28-day unlocking period. 
5. After the unlocking period has been completed, tokens become available for withdrawal/claim. 


### Example

Total tokens to delegate: 1000 SQT

* Bonded: 800 SQT 
* 300: delegated  to Indexer A
* 300: delegated  to Indexer B
* 200: available to bond
* Un-bonding: 200 SQT
* 100: unbonded at block 2000, withdrawable at block x(28 days)
* 100: unbonded at block 2500, withdrawable at block y(28 days)
