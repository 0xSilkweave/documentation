## SubQuery Kepler Network

SubQuery’s mission is to help developers create the decentralised products of the future. In order to realise this, the final phase before launching the SubQuery Network was deploying the Kepler Network.

:::note

SubQuery Kepler is now retired, all previous members can swap their KSQT for SQT via the official [Kepler Swap Mechanism](../token/swap.md).

### Why Did We Launch Kepler?

You can think of Kepler as a pre-mainnet, a controlled phase that helped us bootstrap the mainnet with participants and activity.

In order to launch our decentralised network (The SubQuery Network), there are several technical milestones that must be met. The first significant milestone was achieved in 2022, with three successful ‘seasons’ (or phases) of our Frontier testnet which stress-tested the network in a test environment. After taking these learnings, we elected to take a novel approach by allowing participants in our testnet to get started on real world projects now via Kepler rather than waiting for the launching of our token.

A further consideration is that when we survey the web3 ecosystem today, we see that many other projects that provide decentralised services have made poor progress migrating customers from their centralised services to their decentralised alternatives. Kepler is designed to migrate real projects from our managed service to the decentralised SubQuery Kepler Network in a carefully choreographed way whilst providing incentives to all.

The rationale is that we can demonstrate both the technical and commercial applications of the SubQuery Network and bootstrap the mainnet with participants and activity to accelerate our growth.

## KSQT

kSQT is the name of the token that is used by participants who operate within the Kepler Network. This token mimics the properties of the eventual SubQuery Network token (SQT) in that tokens will be rewarded to Node Operators for performing tasks and Delegators can allocate their tokens to Node Operators to secure the network and receive rewards.

Kepler is designed to enable participants to provide value to real projects which are migrated from SubQuery’s managed service to the decentralised offering and receive incentives via the Kepler token (kSQT). The kSQT token is issued with a very limited supply, but users were able to swap kSQT to USDC using the Swap feature.

### Adding kSQT to your Wallet

kSQT is deployed on the Polygon network with the following contract address:

`0xcEE50Ee839a2ab3914cF4c3cbAc78f6F11E0c937` ([PolygonScan](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xcEE50Ee839a2ab3914cF4c3cbAc78f6F11E0c937)).

You can add it to your wallet from the wallet selector in the [Kepler App](https://kepler.subquery.network/explorer).

### How do I Receive kSQT?

The supply of kSQT is intentionally heavily restricted and has been airdropped to Node Operators and Ambassadors to help launch the network and show our appreciation for their support.

Upon the retirement of Kepler, all kSQT can be burnt in exchange for SQT after SubQuery Network launch using our [swap mechanism](../token/swap.md).
