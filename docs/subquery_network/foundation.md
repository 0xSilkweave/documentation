# The SubQuery Foundation

The SubQuery Foundation serves to manage and develop the SubQuery Network and its ecosystem. Its purpose is to foster and guide the development and growth of the SubQuery Network and provide support for users and developers to build their own SubQuery Projects.

The SubQuery Foundation is the first step towards decentralising ownership over the SubQuery Network.
