# Swap kSQT for USDC

:::warning

Now that the SubQuery Mainet have been announced, we have disabled swaps of USDC.e -> kSQT and kSQT -> USDC.e. After SubQuery's TGE on the 23rd of February we will allow direct swaps of kSQT for SQT at a premium rate (1:1.83) when the network launches.

:::

Swaps allows users to swap kSQT to USDC.

While kSQT will not have transfer restrictions, we do not envision it as a free-float token, hence will not provide or support liquidity. kSQT will have a controlled supply that is intended to be just enough for the minimum viable network running with limited capabilities.

SubQuery will offer a basic swap mechanism for kSQT rewards (but not the airdrop itself). You will be able to use this swap mechanism to convert rewards earned via indexing and delegation into USDC at a predetermined rate. The swap contract will be seeded with just enough USDC to purchase all reward emissions over the lifetime of Kepler. This is done with the sole purpose of reimbursing infrastructure costs incurred by the Node Operators, hopefully at a profit - this exercise will allow us to calibrate reward emissions in conditions close to the real market.

The reward tokens acquired by the swap contract become available for release to potential delegators, who wish to get hold of kSQT and participate in the Kepler Network. The swap contract will also have a spread between the acquiring and releasing rates discouraging idle swapping and speculation.
