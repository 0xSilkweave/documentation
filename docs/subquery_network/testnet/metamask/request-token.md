# How to Request Testnet Tokens?

There are two types of tokens on the SubQuery Testnet:

- DEV tokens (the equivalent of ETH) for gas fee
- SQT tokens for staking

You can receive DEV and SQT tokens from the faucet channel under the Frontier Testnet Group in SubQueryâ€™s Discord community.

## Dev tokens

- Copy your account address from MetaMask and type `!drip <address>` to send SQT and DEV tokens to a given address. You can only make this call **once per hour**.
- You will receive the tokens within a few minutes. <br />

DEV tokens can be addressed as anything. Here it is called SQT_TESTNET. <br />
