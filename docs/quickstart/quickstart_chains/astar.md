# Astar Quick Start

## Goals

This quick guide explains how the Astar Wasm starter project works indexing all Transactions and Approvals from the Astar Wasm based lottery contract.

Previously, in the [1. Create a New Project](../quickstart.md) section, [3 key files](../quickstart.md#_3-make-changes-to-your-project) were mentioned. Let's take a closer look at these files.

## 1. GraphQL Schema File

The `schema.graphql` file determines the shape of your data from SubQuery due to the mechanism of the GraphQL query language. Hence, updating the GraphQL Schema file is the perfect place to start. It allows you to define your end goal right at the start.

The Astar-wasm-starter project has two entities. A Transaction and an Approval entity. These index basic block data such as the timestamp, heigh and hash along with from and contract addresses and the value.

```graphql
type Transaction @entity {
  id: ID! # Transaction hash
  transactionHash: String
  blockHeight: BigInt
  blockHash: String
  timestamp: Date
  value: BigInt
  from: String!
  contractAddress: String!
}

type Approval @entity {
  id: ID! # Transaction hash
  blockHeight: BigInt
  value: BigInt
  hash: String
  owner: String!
  spender: String!
  contractAddress: String!
}

```

::: warning Important
When you make any changes to the schema file, please ensure that you regenerate your types directory.
:::

::: code-tabs
@tab:active yarn

```shell
yarn codegen
```

@tab npm

```shell
npm run-script codegen
```

:::

You will find the generated models in the `/src/types/models` directory.

Check out the [GraphQL Schema](../../build/graphql.md) documentation to get in-depth information on `schema.graphql` file.

## 2. The Project Manifest File

The Project Manifest (`project.yaml`) file works as an entry point to your project. It defines most of the details on how SubQuery will index and transform the chain data. For Substrate/Polkadot chains, there are three types of mapping handlers:

- [BlockHanders](../../build/manifest/polkadot.md#mapping-handlers-and-filters): On each and every block, run a mapping function
- [EventHandlers](../../build/manifest/polkadot.md#mapping-handlers-and-filters): On each and every Event that matches optional filter criteria, run a mapping function
- [CallHanders](../../build/manifest/polkadot.md#mapping-handlers-and-filters): On each and every extrinsic call that matches optional filter criteria, run a mapping function

For EVM/WASM chains, there are two types of mapping handlers:

- [EventHandlers](../../build/substrate-wasm.html#event-handlers): On each and every Event that matches optional filter criteria, run a mapping function
- [CallHanders](../../build/substrate-wasm.html#call-handlers): On each and every extrinsic call that matches optional filter criteria, run a mapping function

Note that the manifest file has already been set up correctly and doesnâ€™t require any changes for this starter project.

**Since we are planning to index all Polkadot transfers, we need to update the `datasources` section as follows:**

```yaml
dataSources:
  - kind: substrate/Wasm
    startBlock: 3281780
    processor:
      file: ./node_modules/@subql/substrate-wasm-processor/dist/bundle.js
      options:
        abi: erc20
        #contract: "a6Yrf6jAPUwjoi5YvvoTE4ES5vYAMpV55ZCsFHtwMFPDx7H" Shibuya
        contract: "bZ2uiFGTLcYyP8F88XzXa13xu5Mmp13VLiaW1gGn7rzxktc" #Mainnet
    assets:
      erc20:
        file: ./erc20Metadata.json
    mapping:
      file: ./dist/index.js
      handlers:
        - handler: handleWasmEvent
          kind: substrate/WasmEvent
          filter:
            #contract: "a6Yrf6jAPUwjoi5YvvoTE4ES5vYAMpV55ZCsFHtwMFPDx7H" Shibuya
            contract: "bZ2uiFGTLcYyP8F88XzXa13xu5Mmp13VLiaW1gGn7rzxktc" #Mainnet
```

This indicates that you will be running a `handleWasmEvent` mapping function whenever there is an event emitted from the `contract=bZ2uiFGTLcYyP8F88XzXa13xu5Mmp13VLiaW1gGn7rzxktc`.

Check out our [Manifest File](../../build/manifest/polkadot.md) documentation to get more information about the Project Manifest (`project.yaml`) file.

## 3. Mapping Functions

Mapping functions define how chain data is transformed into the optimised GraphQL entities that we previously defined in the `schema.graphql` file.

Navigate to the default mapping function in the `src/mappings` directory. There are two  exported functions: `handleEvent`, and `handleCall`.

```ts
export async function handleWasmEvent(event: WasmEvent<TransferEventArgs>): Promise<void> {
  logger.info("Event payload is: " + JSON.stringify (event))
  const [arg, value] = event.args;
  const transaction = Transaction.create({
    id: `${event.blockNumber}-${event.eventIndex}`,
    transactionHash: event.transactionHash,
    blockHash: event.blockHash,
    timestamp: event.timestamp,
    blockHeight: BigInt(event.blockNumber),
    from: event.from.toString(),
    value: BigInt(value.toString()),
    contractAddress: event.contract.toString(),
  });

  await transaction.save();
}
```

The `handleEvent` function receives event data whenever an event matches the filters that was specified previously in the `project.yaml`. It extracts the various data from the blockchain and assigns it to the associated variables. Then the `.save()` function is used to save the new entity (_SubQuery will automatically save this to the database_).

Check out our [Mappings](../../build/mapping/polkadot.md) documentation to get detailed information on mapping functions.

## 4. Build Your Project

Next, build your work to run your new SubQuery project. Run the build command from the project's root directory as given here:

::: code-tabs
@tab:active yarn

```shell
yarn build
```

@tab npm

```shell
npm run-script build
```

:::

::: warning Important
Whenever you make changes to your mapping functions, make sure to rebuild your project.
:::

## 5. Run Your Project Locally with Docker

SubQuery provides a Docker container to run projects very quickly and easily for development purposes.

The docker-compose.yml file defines all the configurations that control how a SubQuery node runs. For a new project, which you have just initialised, you won't need to change anything.

Run the following command under the project directory:

::: code-tabs
@tab:active yarn

```shell
yarn start:docker
```

@tab npm

```shell
npm run-script start:docker
```

:::

::: tip
It may take a few minutes to download the required images and start the various nodes and Postgres databases.
:::

Visit [Running SubQuery Locally](../../run_publish/run.md) to get more information on the file and the settings.

## 6. Query Your Project

Once the container is running, navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser and run the sample GraphQL command provided in the README file. Below is an example query from the Astar-wasm-starter project.

```graphql
query {
  transactions(
    first:3 
    orderBy:BLOCK_HEIGHT_ASC){
    totalCount
    nodes{
      id
      timestamp
      blockHeight
      transactionHash
      blockHash
      contractAddress
      from
      value
    }
  }
}
```
::: tip
There is a _Docs_ tab on the right side of the playground which should open a documentation drawer. This documentation is automatically generated and helps you find what entities and methods you can query. To learn more about the GraphQL Query language [here](../../run_publish/graphql.md).
:::

You should see results similar to below:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "transactions": {
      "totalCount": 17,
      "nodes": [
        {
