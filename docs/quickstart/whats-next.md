Now that you have a clear understanding of how to build a basic SubQuery project, let us guide you through the next steps of your journey. 

* Jump to the [Build ](../../build/introduction.md) section and learn more about the three key files: **the manifest file, the GraphQL schema, and the mappings file.**

* Head to our [Courses](../../academy/academy.md) section to learn about important concepts with corresponding exercises and lab workbooks. You will get access to readily available and open-source projects. 

* Explore more ways to run and publish your project, in the [Run & Publish](../../run_publish/run.md) section. Here you will find information about all the ways to run your SubQuery project, along with advanced GraphQL aggregation and subscription features.
